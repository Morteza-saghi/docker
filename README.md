## Introduction to Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within lightweight, portable containers. Containers include everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

## Installing Docker

### On Windows
1. Download Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. Once installed, start Docker Desktop.
4. Verify the installation by running `docker --version` in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

### On macOS
1. Download Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Docker to the Applications folder.
3. Launch Docker from Applications.
4. Verify the installation by running `docker --version` in the terminal.

### On Linux
1. Update your existing package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update

    Install required packages:

    bash

sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

Add Docker’s official GPG key:

bash

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

Set up the stable repository:

bash

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

Install Docker Engine:

bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

    Verify the installation by running docker --version.

Basic Docker Concepts
Images

Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. They contain the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
Containers

Containers are instances of Docker images. They are isolated, portable, and can run on any Docker-supported system.
Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script containing instructions on how to build a Docker image.
Volumes

Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
Networks

Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other, as well as with external systems.
Working with Docker Images
Pulling Images

To download an image from Docker Hub:

bash

docker pull <image-name>

Listing Images

To list all images on your system:

bash

docker images

Removing Images

To remove an image:

bash

docker rmi <image-id>

Working with Docker Containers
Running Containers

To run a container from an image:

bash

docker run <image-name>

To run a container in detached mode:

bash

docker run -d <image-name>

Stopping Containers

To stop a running container:

bash

docker stop <container-id>

Removing Containers

To remove a stopped container:

bash

docker rm <container-id>

Viewing Logs

To view the logs of a container:

bash

docker logs <container-id>

Dockerfile: Building Your Own Images
Basic Structure

A Dockerfile typically consists of the following instructions:

    FROM: Specifies the base image.
    RUN: Executes a command during the build process.
    COPY or ADD: Copies files from the host machine to the container.
    CMD or ENTRYPOINT: Specifies the command to run when the container starts.

Creating a Dockerfile

Here is an example Dockerfile:

Dockerfile

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Building an Image

To build an image from a Dockerfile:

bash

docker build -t <image-name> .

Docker Volumes: Managing Data
Creating Volumes

To create a volume:

bash

docker volume create <volume-name>

Mounting Volumes

To mount a volume to a container:

bash

docker run -d -v <volume-name>:/path/in/container <image-name>

Inspecting Volumes

To inspect a volume:

bash

docker volume inspect <volume-name>

Docker Networks: Managing Connectivity
Default Networks

Docker automatically creates three networks on installation:

    bridge: The default network for containers.
    none: For containers with no network.
    host: For containers that use the host's network stack.

Creating a Network

To create a custom network:

bash

docker network create <network-name>

Connecting Containers to a Network

To connect a running container to a network:

bash

docker network connect <network-name> <container-id>

Docker Compose: Multi-Container Applications
Installing Docker Compose

Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop. On Linux, install it separately:

bash

sudo apt install docker-compose

docker-compose.yml Basics

A docker-compose.yml file defines a multi-container Docker application. Here’s an example:

yaml

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"

Running a Multi-Container Application

To run the application defined in docker-compose.yml:

bash

docker-compose up

Docker in Production
Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is Docker’s native clustering and orchestration tool. It allows you to manage a group of Docker engines as a single Swarm.
Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Best Practices

    Use .dockerignore to exclude files from the build context.
    Always pin versions in your Dockerfile to avoid breaking changes.
    Keep your images small by minimizing layers and using multi-stage builds.
    Regularly prune unused images, containers, and volumes.
